# Suicides Data Analysis
In this project, I will analyze the trend of suicides in the world, exploring factors such as gender and age group. 
I will use a dataset from kaggle.com to identify significant patterns and trends.

The data was taken from 'Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016' on the Kaggle website. 
It contains the annual number of suicides from 101 countries, divided by sex and age groups. 
Additionally, it includes the annual suicide rate for each country (suicides per 100,000 people) from 1985 to 2016.


The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the suicidal phenomenon worldwide,
analyzing the temporal trend and the variability of suicide rates by country, age groups, and gender.
